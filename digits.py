    # train a network of perceptrons (no hidden
    # layers) with the help of patterns (images) and
    # answers (labels)
    # – classify a test set of patterns and return the
    # classifications
    # – The input patterns are stored in a training
    # image file
    # – The correct classifications for these are stored
    # in a training label file
    # – The patterns you should classify are stored in
    # a validation image file – consists of new
    # images
    # – The answers we use to check your result is
    # called the validation label file
